- Description : NGINX notes
-
- ## What Is A Web Server
	- Handles https request. not a servlet container, still need tomcat
- ## What Is NGINX
	- An open source software
	- Web server for reverse proxying, caching, and load balancing
	- Provides http server capabilities
	- Designed for maximum performance and stability
	- Functions a proxy server for email (imap, pop3, and smtp)
	- Uses a non-thread and event driven software
- ## NGINX architecture
	- ![nxginx arch.png](../assets/nxginx_arch_1642342899902_0.png)
	- ### Master
		- Only 1 master node
		- Responsible for reading and validating configuration
		- Creating binding and crossing sockets
		- Responsible for terminating and maintaining the configured number of worker processes
		- Responsible for reconfiguring without any service interruption
		- Controls non-stop binary upgrades and reopening of the log files
		- Compiles embedded Perl scripts
	- ### Worker
		- Single thread processes
		- Handles thousands of concurrent connections every seconds
		- Accepts new requests from a shared list of socket and execute a highly efficient run loop inside each work process
	- ### Proxy Cache
		- #### Cache Loader
			- Mainly responsible for checking the on disk cache items and populating engine in-memory database with the cache metadata
			- Prepares engine instances to work  with files already stored in the disk
			- Checks cache contents with the metadata
			- Updates the relevant entries in shared memory
		- #### Cache Manager
			- Responsible cache expiration and validation
			- Restarted by the master node in case of failure
			- Visited page are stored in the cache so that revisiting it again will be retrieved in the cache and will not go to the whole process
	- ### Backend
		- #### Webserver
		- #### Application Server
		- #### Memcached
- ## Why Use NGINX
	- Ease of installation and maintenance
	- Improves performance
	- Reduces the wait time for users
	- Load balancing
	- On the fly upgrade
- ## configuration settings
	- ### worker_processes
		- Defines the number of processes
	- ### worker_connections
		- Maximum number of simultaneously connections served by nginx
	- ### access_log & error_log
		- Access log events and errors
	- ### gzip
		- gzip compressions
- ## Installing NGINX
	- ### Install NGINX
		- sudo wget http://nginx.org/keys/nginx_signing.key (get nginx key)
		- sudo apt-key add nginx_signing.key (add nginx key to apt)
		- sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nginx.list
		- sudo add nginx repository (set the correct linux distro installed)
		- sudo apt update
		- sudo apt-get update
		- sudo apt-get install nginx
		- nginx -v (check if nginx installed)
	- ### Adjust Firewall
		- sudo ufw enable (enable firewall)
		- sudo ufw app list (list available apps)
		- sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
		- sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
		- sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTPS'
	- ### Check Server
		- sudo ufw status (check firewall status)
		- sudo systemctl status nginx (check nginx service)
		- sudo systemctl enable nginx (if nginx is disabled)
		- systemctl restart nginx (restart nginx)
		- systemctl stop nginx (stop nginx)
		- systemctl start nginx (start nginx)
		- systemctl reload nginx (reload conf files without restart the whole service)
	- ### Manage NGINX Process
		- cd /etc/nginx (nginx directory, contains confs)
		- sudo vi nginx.conf (open nginx conf)
		- sudo vi conf.d/default.conf (open default conf file for the defaul nginx page, server block, conf per web app)
	- ### Reverse Proxy
		- setup first the host to proxy to (nodejs, docker, snap package, java app, or a web host)
		- cd /etc/nginx/conf.d
		- sudo vi <conf_name>.conf (setup the conf, location.proxy_pass is used to set the proxy)
		- sudo mv default.conf default.conf.disabled (rename default.conf to disable)
		- nginx -t (test confs)
		- nginx -s reload (reload confs)
	- ### Load Balancer
