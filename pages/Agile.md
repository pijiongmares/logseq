- constant iteration of plan -> build -> test -> review
### stakeholder
- outside the scrum team, customer
### product owner
- manager, make sure the app deployed and committed. make sure the app is built it has to be. does not mean a technical person
### scrum master
- team leader, running meetings, review tasks
### team
### product backlogs
- smaller tasks (plan -> build -> test -> review)
- done over a period of time
- bits of features
- product owner and scrum master are the ones to determine the backlogs
### user stories
- a single product backlog is called a user story
### sprint planning
- product owner explains how is the end goal
### sprint backlog
- prioritized user stories. what to work on first
### daily scrum
- daily meeting
### sprint review
- end of the user story. each and every user story usually ends in 2 weeks
### sprint retrospective
