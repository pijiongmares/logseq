	- ### Scrum
	- ![scrum model.jpg](../assets/scrum_model_1642338830927_0.jpg)
	- Constant iteration of plan -> build -> test -> review
		- #### Stakeholder
			- Outside the scrum team, customer
		- #### Product Owner
			- Manager, make sure the app deployed and committed. make sure the app is built it has to be. does not mean a technical person
### scrum master
- team leader, running meetings, review tasks
### team
### product backlogs
- smaller tasks (plan -> build -> test -> review)
- done over a period of time
- bits of features
- product owner and scrum master are the ones to determine the backlogs
### user stories
- a single product backlog is called a user story
### sprint planning
- product owner explains how is the end goal
### sprint backlog
- prioritized user stories. what to work on first
### daily scrum
- daily meeting
### sprint review
- end of the user story. each and every user story usually ends in 2 weeks
### sprint retrospective
